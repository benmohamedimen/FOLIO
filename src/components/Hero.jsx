    ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Senior Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, and modern web technologies like Vite and Tailwind CSS. Over the years, Iâ€™ve designed and developed user-centric web applications, including interactive dashboards, dynamic reports, and real-time systems, catering to diverse business needs.

With a passion for creating intuitive and scalable solutions, Iâ€™ve contributed to building robust full-stack applications using Django, Node.js, and MongoDB Atlas, as well as leading critical modules like Customer Service tools for enhanced user experiences.

I thrive in environments where I can combine my technical expertise with my ability to collaborate across teams and deliver impactful results. Currently, Iâ€™m seeking opportunities where I can leverage my skills to drive innovative projects and create value in the digital space.
